Since January 2026, I have led the ANR-funded project  "Compression and Alignment for Efficient Machine Learning". More details are available [here]({{ "/calme/" | calme.md }}). 

### Very smart students whom I am fortunate to supervise in their thesis

#### - [Arthur Lebeurrier](https://artim436.github.io/), Sept 2024 - present -
Co-supervision with [Rémi Gribonval](https://people.irisa.fr/Remi.Gribonval/) (HDR) and CNES.
*Optimized on-board decision with fast energy-efficient neural networks*. 

#### - [Can Pouliquen](https://perceptronium.github.io/), Nov 2022 - Dec 2025 -
Co-supervision with [Mathurin Massias](https://mathurinm.github.io/) and [Paulo Gonçalves](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/paulo.goncalves/) (HDR).
*Automatic estimation of functional connectivity graphs in neuroscience*. 
Objective: Develop machine learning methods for faithfully, rapidly, and without calibration estimating dynamic graphs from M/EEG signals.

#### - [Hugues Van Assel](https://huguesva.github.io/), Sept 2021 - Dec 2024 -
Co-supervision with [Aurélien Garivier](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/aurelien.garivier/www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/_agarivie/index.html) (HDR). 
*Latent graphical models for dimensionality reduction*. 
Objective: Develop new dimensionality reduction methods using tools from optimal transport, graph analysis, and probabilistic modeling.


### Some workshops
- We organized with [Rémi Flamary](https://remi.flamary.com/) the GDR IASIS dat ‘‘Optimal transport and its applications in machine learning and data analysis'' (February 17, 2025). [Link to the program](https://gdr-iasis.cnrs.fr/reunions/transport-optimal-et-ses-applications-en-machine-learning-et-analyse-de-donnees/).
- We organized with [Mathurin Massias](https://mathurinm.github.io/) the RT MIA thematic day entitled ‘‘Dimensionality Reduction for Learning and Visualization'' (November 10, 2023). [Link to the program](https://gdr-mia.math.cnrs.fr/events/dimreduc/).
- In partnership with IXXI, we organized the day entitled ‘‘Frugality and Machine Learning'' (September 11, 2023). [Link to the program](https://www.ixxi.fr/agenda/seminaires/frugalite-et-apprentissage-machine).
- We organized with [Arnaud Breloy](https://abreloy.github.io/) the special session entitled ‘‘Graph Learning and Learning with Graphs'' during [GRETSI 2023](https://gretsi.fr/colloque2023/sessions-speciales/).
